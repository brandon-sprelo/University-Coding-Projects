### Introduction

--- 

#### Motivation

I have been investing in stocks since 2015 ever since my mom showed me her 
portfolio. I am interested in stocks because of my appeal to the process of 
developing the unqiue analytical skills needed to profit in the market. 
The concept of betting is a zero sum game that rewards the winner for 
his/her confidence in his/her decision. The fundamentals of betting comes down
to raising the probability of winning through a person's analytical skills. 

Unlike STEM classes' analytical skills which are primarily developed through hard 
skills, the analytical skills required for a successful investment are much more 
broad because the information channels for the markets are so broad. For example, 
to increase the probability of successfully building a Shiny APP, the tools 
required are Shiny, knowledge of R, and other packages needed for the Server 
section of Shiny. However, for investing, knowledge to increase the probability 
of success can be gained through technical skills and soft skills. 

I have been primarily investing in Asia stocks through soft skills without much 
development of technical market skills. In essence, I have traveled back and forth 
between USA and China so many times that I am able to identify the analogies 
between the two countriesâ€™ companies. And since China's economy is still in the
process of catching up to USA's, I am able to look at a China company's 
infrastructure and value to determine which USA company it is most similar too. 
Then, I identify if the company's security is a good buy or not based on its 
long term growth. 

The motivation behind this blog post is to back up an investment with both 
technical skills and soft skills. Since I already have developed some soft skills, 
I will use this post to develop some technical skills. Keep in mind, both skills 
are analytical so the code chunks in this blog post will be to mainly generate 
supportive information that makes my arguments for my bets stronger. 

#### Content

I am going to first show you how to download stock data from yahoo finance. 
Then I will show you how to acquire a company's financials with `quantmod`. 
Then, I will explain how the equation of ARIMA works so that we have a better grasp
of the equation when we plot the data and manipualte the data sets. We 
will manipulate our stock data so that we can create relavent plots from our data.
Finally, we will use ARIMA to predict the stock prices for the next two years.

### Data Preparation

#### Downloading Historical Quote Data 

The three stocks I will be analyzing are: 

1. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TCEHY/history?period1=1354521600&period2=1512288000&interval=1mo&filter=history&frequency=1mo

2. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GELYF/history?period1=1354521600&period2=1512288000&interval=1mo&filter=history&frequency=1mo

3. https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BZUN/history?period1=1354521600&period2=1512288000&interval=1mo&filter=history&frequency=1mo

To download the csv for each URL: 

1. Enter the link into the browser. 

2. Select a time period of 5Y and Apply.

3. Click on Download Data. 

5. Name the file as the stock symbol. Example: For tcehy, name the file as 
"tcehy.csv". 

6. Download the file into the data folder. 

7. Import each dataset into R Studio. 

``` {r} 
#setwd to your data folder 
setwd("/Users/brandon/Desktop/stat133/Post/post02/data")

#import tcehy data
tcehy <- read.csv("tcehy.csv") 

#import gelyf data
gelyf <- read.csv("gelyf.csv")

#import bzun data
bzun <- read.csv("bzun.csv") 
```

#### Collecting Financials with QuantMod. 

Quantmod downloads income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements 
from Google Finance. tcehy and gelyf's financials are not available on Google 
Finance so this portion will only be for bzun. The downloaded container for 
the financial statements is a custom S3 object of type "financials". 

```{r}
#download financials of baozun
getFinancials("bzun") 
```

`viewFinancials()` is a function from the package `quantmod`. `viewFinancials()`
is comprised of three elements. 

1. custom S3 object of type "financials".
2. type = c('BS', 'IS', 'CF')
    * BS = Balance Sheet
    * IS = Income Statement
    * CF = Cash Flow 
3. period = c('A', 'Q')
    * A = Annual
    * Q = Quarterly

Lets extract the annual balance sheet for bzun into a dataframe so that we can 
manipulate the data or print it into an app. 

``` {r} 
#extract annual balance sheet into a data frame
bzunBS <- data.frame(viewFinancials(bzun.f, type = ('BS'), period = "A")) 

#omit rows with NA in bzunBS
bzunBS <- na.omit(bzunBS)

#write bzun into data folder 
write.csv(bzunBS, file = 'bzunBS.csv') 
```

### ARIMA: Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average 

---

ARIMA is a time series equation that predicts stock prices over time. In general, 
time series model relationships using data collected over time. Time series 
involves decomposition of the data into a trend, seasonal, cyclical, or irregular
component. The decomposition depends on the patterns found in the data. For example, 
air passengers travel due to seasonality.

For example, the graph of air passengers vs. time is the decomposition of the 
data into seasons because a large proportion of air passengers decide to travel 
due to seasons. For example, during thanksgiving and winter, more people 
travel due to holidays. The following data is not reproducible because it is an 
example of what a seasonal decomposition would look like and it is not needed
for our post. 

``` {r}
setwd("/Users/brandon/Desktop/stat133/Post/post01/Data")
cbe <- read.table(file = 'cbe.dat', header = T) #create matrix cbe

data(AirPassengers) #acquire airpassengers
AP <- AirPassengers

elec_ts <- ts(cbe$elec, start = 1958, freq = 12) #create ts for electricity 

#time series: intersect air passengers and electricity
ap_elec <- ts.intersect(AP, elec_ts)  

plot(ap_elec[ , 1], 
     ylab = "Air Passengers / 1000's", 
     main = 'Graph of Air Passengers vs. Time') #plot x = time, y = air passengers
```

#### Lags

Lags are a very important aspect of regressive models because regressive models 
should not only take into account the independent and dependent variables but 
also "lag". Lag is the relation between current and past data. For example, when 
we compute the stock prediction; we must also take into account the relation of 
current price compared to the past price and not only the price (dependent variable)
and the time (independent variable). In essence, a regression equation that does
not take lag into account is overestimating the weights of the independent 
and dependent variable. Therefore, a regression without lag would not be as accurate. 
In the following segments, I will specifically note where the equation takes
lag into the equation.

#### AutoRegressive 

![AR(p) is an AR model with p lags](pictures/ar.jpg)

"p" is the past periods that we need to take into account to predict future prices. 
"p" realizes that the value in one period is related to the value in a previous 
period. The $\gamma$ in the equation denotes how much of the past data to retain. 
For example, if the $\gamma$ was set at 0.8, then the next prediction would have to 
retain 0.8 of the past data. Therefore, if the $\gamma$ was -0.8, would the data 
oscillate more or less compared to 0.8? If you answered oscillate more, then you 
are correct because -0.8 would always mean you predict in the opposite direction 
because you are retaining the opposite of the previous data. 

#### Moving Average

The moving average is the average of the data throughout a certain period of time. 
This is very important in forecasting situations and is widely used in stock markets
for technical analysis. When using moving averages in stock markets, you want to set
a couple different moving averages that takes into account different time periods. 
For example, you want to set one at 20, 100, and 180 so that the moving averages
are broader and you can see the trend for each different time period. If the stock 
is rapidly oscillating but overall performing at a positive rate, then the 20 
moving average would follow the oscillation of the stock but the 180 moving average
would have a positive slope because in the long run, the stock will remain positive
in earnings.

#### AutoRegressive and Moving Average

To obtain ARIMA, we combine the AR and MA equations.

#### Predicting Stock Prices with ARIMA 

##### 1. Convert stock price data to time series. The "start" in `ts()` 
refers to the starting date for the stock prices. For example, the tcehy data starts
in December so the start is 2012 and 0 for December. The bzun data starts in April
so the start is 2012 and 4 for April. "freq" denotes that there are 12 months in 
one year. 

``` {r}
# convert data frame of tcehy to time series
tcehy.ts <- ts(tcehy$Close, start = c(2012, 0), freq = 12) 

# convert data frame of tcehy to time series
gelyf.ts <- ts(gelyf$Close, start = c(2012, 0), freq = 12) 

# convert data frame of tcehy to time series
bzun.ts <- ts(bzun$Close, start = c(2015, 7), freq = 12) 
``` 

##### 2. Convert each stock data into a data frame with closing prices and
log of closing prices. This is so that when we graph the values, the x axis
is the actual date of the closing stock prices and not the increasing values
of the number of months. 

``` {r}
# convert tcehy into a data frame with log of closing prices and closing prices
tcehy <- data.frame(closing = tcehy.ts, lclosing = log(tcehy.ts))
save(tcehy, file = "tcehy.df.RData")
load("tcehy.df.RData")

# convert gelyf into a data frame with log of closing prices and closing prices
gelyf <- data.frame(closing = gelyf.ts, lclosing = log(gelyf.ts))
save(gelyf, file = "gelyf.df.RData")
load("gelyf.df.RData")

# convert bzun into a data frame with log of closing prices and closing prices
bzun <- data.frame(closing = bzun.ts, lclosing = log(bzun.ts))
save(bzun, file = "bzun.df.RData")
load("bzun.df.RData")
``` 


##### 3. Plot the stock values 

``` {r}
# line plot for tcehy 
plot(tcehy$closing, 
     main = "Tencent stock price",
     lwd = 2,
     type = "l",
     sub = "December 2012 to December 2017", 
     ylab = "closing price") 

# line plot for gelyf 
plot(gelyf$closing, 
     main = "Geely stock price",
     lwd = 2,
     type = "l",
     sub = "December 2012 to December 2017", 
     ylab = "closing price") 

# line plot for bzun
plot(bzun$closing, 
     main = "Baozun stock price",
     lwd = 2,
     type = "l",
     sub = "April 2015 to December 2017", 
     ylab = "closing price") 
``` 

##### 5. Decomposition: Earlier we talked about the decomposition of a dataset. 
We can decompose each stock data set according to its seasonal, trend, and remainder 
patterns.`stl()` allows us to create a data frame with the patterns. 

``` {r}
# decompose tcehy data set 
tcehy.stl = stl(tcehy$closing, s.window = "periodic")
# plot tcehy stock decomposition data 
plot(tcehy.stl, main = "tencent stock decomposition") 

# decompose tcehy data set 
gelyf.stl = stl(gelyf$closing, s.window = "periodic")
# plot tcehy stock decomposition data 
plot(gelyf.stl, main = "geely stock decomposition") 

# decompose tcehy data set 
bzun.stl = stl(bzun$closing, s.window = "periodic")
# plot tcehy stock decomposition data 
plot(bzun.stl, main = "baozun stock decomposition") 
``` 

##### 6. Forecasting 

``` {r}
# TENCENT
# h = 24 is 24 months which is 2 years, 95% confidence interval 
tcehy.f = forecast(tcehy.stl, 
                   method = "arima", 
                   h = 24, 
                   level = 95)
# plot the forecasted values 
plot(tcehy.f, 
     ylab = "stock price", 
     xlab = "year", 
     main = "TCEHY forecasted stock price for 2 years",
     sub = "forecast from december 2017 to december 2019")

#GEELY
# h = 24 is 24 months which is 2 years, 95% confidence interval 
gelyf.f = forecast(gelyf.stl, 
                   method = "arima", 
                   h = 24, 
                   level = 95)
# plot the forecasted values 
plot(gelyf.f, 
     ylab = "stock price", 
     xlab = "year", 
     main = "GELYF forecasted stock price for 2 years",
     sub = "forecast from december 2017 to december 2019")

#BAOZUN
# h = 24 is 24 months which is 2 years, 95% confidence interval 
bzun.f = forecast(bzun.stl, 
                   method = "arima", 
                   h = 24, 
                   level = 95)
# plot the forecasted values 
plot(bzun.f, 
     ylab = "stock price", 
     xlab = "year", 
     main = "BZUN forecasted stock price for 2 years",
     sub = "forecast from december 2017 to december 2019")

#display baozun's financials too 
print(bzunBS)
```

### Conclusion

---

#### Take Home Message

The ARIMA forecast show that among the three stocks in my portfolio: TCEHY, 
GELYF, and BZUN, I should retain TCEHY and GELYF and sell BZUN because BZUN shows
no rate of growth. 

To conclude, without the technical analysis of my portfolio, I would have kept BZUN 
for an X amount of time and it would have showed no signs of growth but I would not 
know what to do with the stock because I do not have a technical analysis of the stock. 
The take home message is that technical skills is just as important as soft skills when
it comes to investing and having both is the most important aspect of investing
successfully. Statistics plays a huge role in predicting the future with 
current and past data. Therefore, it is very important to integrate statistics
into anything that can benefit from time-series analysis.
